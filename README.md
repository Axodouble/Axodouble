#### Amateur Software-Enthusiast.
I love all things tech, be it software || hardware && more.

Iâ€™m currently working on numerous projects and wish to further my knowledge in all fields I have any interest in.
You can reach me at [@Axodouble](https://twitter.com/axodouble) on Twitter, [axodouble@axodouble.tech](mailto:axodouble.tech) per email & [@Axodouble#0001](https://discord.com) on Discord.

I do play some games and I am interested in learning more on their mechanics, systems or anything related to it, be it modifications to the games code, addons, plugins or et cetera. 
I have experience in `Node.JS`, `Java`, `C#`, `PHP` & `HTML`.

Primarily looking at development of Minecraft Client Modifications, and I am currently actively working on numerous private projects, though recently learned that committing changes to a branch of something does not show on your activity haha!
