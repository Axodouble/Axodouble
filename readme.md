#### Software developer, nothing fancy.
I love all things tech, practically only worked on it all my life.

Iâ€™m currently working on numerous projects and wish to further my knowledge in all fields!

I do play some games and I am interested in learning more on their mechanics, systems or anything related to it, be it modifications to the games code, addons, plugins or et cetera. 
I have experience in `Node.JS`, `Java`, `C#`, `C++`, `Rust`, `PHP` & `Python`.
