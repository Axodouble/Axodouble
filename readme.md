#### Software developer, nothing fancy.
I love all things tech, practically only worked on it all my life.

Iâ€™m currently working ~~on numerous projects and wish to further~~ at a new development company! I am incredibly happy at this new opportunity and I am excited to further my knowledge in all fields!
You can reach me at [@Axodouble](https://twitter.com/axodouble) on Twitter, [axodouble@axodouble.tech](mailto:axodouble@axodouble.tech) per email & [@axodouble](https://discord.com) on Discord.

I do play some games and I am interested in learning more on their mechanics, systems or anything related to it, be it modifications to the games code, addons, plugins or et cetera. 
I have experience in `Node.JS`, `Java`, `C#`, `C++`, `Rust` & `PHP`.

I am currently working at 2 locations, a software developer working for a large tech firm & a software developer for UDarkRP, creating custom content such as specialized modifications and more; though I also have experience in physical modding, creating custom FPV drones and custom airsoft parts.
