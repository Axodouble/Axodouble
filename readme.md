#### Software developer, nothing fancy.
I love all things tech, practically only worked on it all my life.

Iâ€™m currently working on numerous projects and wish to further my knowledge in all fields!
You can reach me at [@Axodouble](https://twitter.com/axodouble) on Twitter, [axodouble@gmail.com](mailto:axodouble@gmail.com) per email & [@axodouble]([https://discord.com](https://xdbl.dev/?l=0eSF3)) on [Discord](https://xdbl.dev/?l=0eSF3).

I do play some games and I am interested in learning more on their mechanics, systems or anything related to it, be it modifications to the games code, addons, plugins or et cetera. 
I have experience in `Node.JS`, `Java`, `C#`, `C++`, `Rust`, `PHP` & `Python`.

I am currently working at an unnamed IT Company maintaining active service for over ~80,000 personnel of our company.
I am also currently in a position where I am working as a hoppy on my side project [unturned.guide](https://unturned.guide/), I also work on other things and I take [commissions](https://xdbl.dev/?l=0eSF3) for projects.
